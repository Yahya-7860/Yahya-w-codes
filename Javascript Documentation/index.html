                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language commonly used for web development. It adds interactivity to websites, manipulates the Document Object Model (DOM), and handles events. JavaScript is a vital tool for creating dynamic web applications and is supported by major web browsers, making it integral to client-side scripting in web development.
                </p>
                <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a dynamic, high-level programming language used extensively in web development. It's employed to create interactive and responsive web applications, enhancing user experiences. JavaScript can manipulate a webpage's Document Object Model (DOM), enabling the modification of content and appearance in real-time. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Client-Side: Client-side refers to the part of web development that takes place within a user's web browser. JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are commonly used technologies for client-side scripting. It focuses on creating user interfaces, handling user interactions, and ensuring a responsive and interactive experience for website visitors.</li>
                    <li>Server-Side: Server-side development, on the other hand, occurs on web servers. It involves programming logic and data processing that happens behind the scenes, often using languages like PHP, Python, or Node.js. Server-side code manages databases, handles user authentication, and delivers dynamic content to the client-side, ensuring secure and efficient interactions on websites and web applications.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What you should already know</h2>
                <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lorem, ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Saepe, laboriosam?</li>
                    <li>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Tempora natus nesciunt asperiores necessitatibus eveniet.</li>
                    <li>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Neque asperiores eligendi ea obcaecati officia fuga id voluptatem minus enim dignissimos.</li>

                <h2>JavaScript and Java</h2>
                <p>JavaScript is a lightweight, versatile, and widely-used programming language primarily employed in web development. It runs in web browsers, enabling client-side scripting for creating interactive web pages and applications. JavaScript is known for its dynamic nature, and it plays a crucial role in manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM), handling events, and communicating with servers to provide a seamless user experience on the web.</p>
                <p> Java, in contrast, is a robust, object-oriented, and statically-typed programming language. It is utilized for a wide range of applications, from web and mobile development to enterprise software. Java is known for its platform independence, as it can run on various operating systems. It excels in building large-scale applications, and its runtime environment, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), ensures portability and security. While both JavaScript and Java are essential in the software development world, they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, JavaScript and Java, despite sharing a similar name, are distinct programming languages with different use cases and characteristics. JavaScript is primarily used for web development and client-side scripting, while Java is a versatile language suitable for a wide range of applications, emphasizing platform independence and security. </p>

            <a id="hello"></a>
            <div  class="hello container">
                <h2>Hello World</h2>
                <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the scratchpad and write your first "Hello World" Javascript code:</p>
                <div class="box">
                    <div class="box-content">
                        <p>function greetMe&#40yourName&#41 &#123 alert&#40"Hello"+yourName&#41 ; &#125</p>
                        <p>greetMe&#40"World"&#41 ;</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser</p>
            </div>

            <a id="variable"></a>
            <div class="variable container">
                <h2>Variables</h2>
                <p>Variables are containers for storing various types of data, such as numbers, text, and objects. They play a pivotal role in making a program dynamic and adaptable. In JavaScript, you can declare variables using the var, let, or const keywords. </p>
                <p> The var keyword has been widely replaced by let and const due to improved scoping rules. Variables declared with let are mutable, meaning their values can change, while those declared with const are immutable, making them suitable for values that should not be altered. Variable names are case-sensitive and must start with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign. JavaScript uses dynamic typing, allowing you to change a variable's data type during runtime.</p>
                <p>Variables can hold numbers, strings, arrays, functions, or any other JavaScript data type, making them versatile for various programming tasks. Properly managing variables is essential for creating clean and efficient code in JavaScript, promoting code readability and maintainability.</p>
